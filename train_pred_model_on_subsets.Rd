\title{Train pred model on subsets}
\usage{
train_pred_model_on_subsets(se, assay, outcome, n_size = 10, n_rep = 50, balanced = FALSE, classifier)
}
\arguments{
\item{se}{A se storing the assay, the data and the outcome.}

\item{assay}{A string, storing which of the assays of the se should be chosen.}

\item{outcome}{A string, storing which of the outcomes of the se should be chosen.}

\item{n_size}{An integer defining how many different groupsizes should be used. (Default = 10)}

\item{n_rep}{An integer defining how many reptetions should be performed. (Default = 50)}

\item{balanced}{A logic variable, defining if the trainingset should be balanced or have the same ratios as the original dataset.}

\item{classifier}{A string with the classifier that should be used, from the options of mlr3learners.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the size of the trainingssets, the mean error, the 25 and 75 \% quantile of the error and the pvalue, tested with a one sided wilcox test against the ratio of the smaller group.
}
\description{
This function takes an the data from an se object containing patient data from a pilotstudy to train and test a classifier by randomly splitting the data in two datasets, training the classifier on one set and than testing it on the other. The resulting errorrates are then tested with a one sided Wilcoxon-test against the ratio of the data of the smallest group. Than the function returns the used groupsizes, the pvalue and the mean and 25/ 75 \\% quantile of the errorrates.
